# hello-world
This is my second attempt to learn about GitHub and start depositing the knowledge in it.

I started my "professional" career in 2016 by joining GSK as a Future Leaders Program participant. Since then, I've had roles as a System based Modeler and Manufacturing Simulation & Modeling Group, Principal Statistician in CMC Statistics, and Process Data & Modeling Scientist in Microbial and Cell Culture Development Group.
